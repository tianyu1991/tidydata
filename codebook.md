#index 180
  the index of activity and subject, the first number represent the corresponding subject name, the second number present the activity

#tBodyAcc-mean()-X 
  the avergae of means of signals from body accelerometer at X axial for each subject and each activity 
  
#tBodyAcc-std()-X 
   the avergae of standard derivation of signals from body accelerometer at X axial for each subject and each activity 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
